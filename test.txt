Package os provides a platform-independent interface to operating system functionality. The design is Unix-like, 
although the error handling is Go-like; failing calls return values of type error rather than error numbers. 
Often, more information is available within the error. For example, if a call that takes a file name fails, 
such as Open or Stat, the error will include the failing file name when printed and will be of type *PathError, 
which may be unpacked for more information.
